# Product Demand Forecast


# Objectives
 In this notebook we are going to create, evaluate and compare several models for forecasting product demand

## Project Overview

This Jupyter Notebook project focuses on forecasting product demand using various models and techniques. It includes detailed steps and analyses to ensure accurate predictions.

## WorkFlow

 
 For this model we are going to do the following
 1. Loading the product demand dataset 
 2. Understanding the data for the 5 years 
 3. Data cleaning
 4. Trends Visualization 
 5. Forecast modelling for several models and compare results
   - XGboost
   - ARIMA
   - SARIMA
   - Exponential Smoothing
   
   Evaluation Metrics
   - Mean Absolute Error
   - Mean Absolute Percentage Error
   - Root Mean Squared 
 6. Select best performing model
